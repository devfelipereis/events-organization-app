# Studying React + NodeJS + Express + GraphQL + MongoDB

First off, I'm a beginner learning this technologies, any weird stuff is part of the process :)

I'm reading the source code of other stacks and creating a small one to understand the basics. I think this is a good way to learn once I copy/paste/edit and create some small parts of code. This helps me to understand
more easily and learn faster.

Here you can see stuff from https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate and https://github.com/linnovate/mean. I also read some tutorials from personal blogs, medium, etc...

# What is inside?

* React https://reactjs.org
* <strike>Redux https://redux.js.org</strike> Apollo 2.0 no longer uses Redux. Seems that integrate both is not so simple and as a beginner I will not spend time to do that for now.
* ApolloClient https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client
* NodeJS https://nodejs.org
* Express http://expressjs.com
* GraphQL http://graphql.org https://github.com/graphql/express-graphql
* MongoDB https://www.mongodb.com/
* Mongoose http://mongoosejs.com/
